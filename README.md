> The evaluation results are the sole prerogative of the judges and are final. However, the judges are open to providing explanations for their decisions. Since there is no absolute right or wrong in design, the evaluation is based on the judges' personal preferences and experiences, which naturally vary from person to person. Therefore, we ask for your understanding.
